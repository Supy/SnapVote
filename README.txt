SnapVote : Source Code
======================

We built this project using the Android Studio IDE. As such, in order to rebuild it, it must be opened in Android Studio with a gradle build environment present.

If you want to test the application, copy the snapvote.apk file from the 'final' directory onto an Android device.

Be adviced that our test device was a Samsung Galaxy S3 and you may not see the same performance depending on phone hardware, power saving, or other factors such as running applications.
